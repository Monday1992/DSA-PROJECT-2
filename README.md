KMS CASE STUDY

### INSIGHT ON THE KMS CASE STUDY

 ### MY OBSERVATION
  
BASE ON THE QUERY IT DOES SHOW THAT THE ORDER_PRIORITY, IMPACT THE SHIPPING_COST

A. BASE ON THE QUERY, DELIVERY TRUCK WHICH IS MORE ECONOMICAL AND SLOWER IS USED TO DELIVER HIGH
AND CRITICAL PRODUCT WHICH IS AT RISK OF LATE DELIVERY AND SOME PRODUCT BEEN DAMAGED AT THE PROCESS
OF TRANSPORTATION. WHICH COULD CAUSE CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION.

THERE FORE SAVING ON COST AT THE EXPENESE OF SERVICE QUALITY.

B. BASE ON THE QUERY, THE HIGHTEST SHIPPING_COST DOESN'T MATCH THE ORDER_PRIORITY THUS, SHIPPING_COST
ARE NOT STRICTLY BASE ON URGENCY, BUT ON PROFIT MAXIMIZATION.

### MY RECOMMENDATION

----THE EXPRESS AIR SHOULD BE USED FOR PRODUCT OF HIGH, URGENT AND CRITICAL ORDER_PRIORITY

----THE REGULAR AIR SHOULD BE USED FOR MEDIUM AND NOT SPECIFIED ORDER_PRIORITY

----THE  DELIVERY TRUCK SHOULD BE USED FOR LOW  ORDER_PRIORITY.

THIS WAY THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE MAXIMUM SATTISFACTION TO HIS CUSTOMER WHY MAXIMIZING SHIPPING_COST
AND IN TERMS ALSO MAXIMIZING PROFIT.


### REGADING ON HOW TO INCREASE THE REVENUE OF THE BOTTOM CUSTOMERS THIS IS MY RECOMMENDATION

------ ADVISE ON TO INCREASE REVENUE OF THE 10 BOTTOM CUSTOMERS-----

--SALES, IN TERMS OF SALES FOR THE BOTTOM 10 CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY SHOULD GIVE A RESNABLR DISCOUNT TO THE 
CUSTOMERS IN THAT WAY IT WILL GREATLY AFFECT THIER PURACHING POWER POSTIVELY IN TURN INCREASE THEIER REVENUE.

----SHIPPING: IF THE SHIPPING COST IS HIGHT IT AFFECT THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT WHICH WILL BE TO EXPENSIVE FOR  
 THE BOTTOM CUSTOMERS, THEREFORE THE MANGEMENT SHOULD CUT DOWN ON THE SHIPPING COST, IN THAT WAY IT WILL
 AFFECT THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT THUS INCREASING THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THE BOTTOM CUSTOMERS.

----CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR: CUSTOMERS PURCHASING POWER IS BASE ON THEIR INCOME, SO WHEN THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT
IS LOW THE CUSTOMER WILL PURACHE MORE THEREFORE THE MANGEMENT SHOULD BUT INTO CONSIDRATION THE INCOME OF THEIR
CUSTOMERS VIS-AVIS THE COST OF THE PRODUCT.
